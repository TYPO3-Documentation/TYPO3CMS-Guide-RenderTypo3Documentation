FYI:

(1) Eric Holscher is the cool guy that runs the "ReadTheDocs" site. With our TYPO3 theme we are using a descendant of his ReadTheDocsTheme. That's why I chose `t3SphinxThemeRtd` as name for our theme.

(2) Now: RTD now supports "CommonMark", which is seen as a common standard of Markdown. Read his blogpost. [1]

(3) I'm keeping an eye on what Eric Holscher does. So I've implemented the same support of the MarkCommon dialect of markdown in our new toolchain.

(4) The new toolchain is already used for all of the "official manuals".

(5) I'm working on the last Baustein (building block) missing in the toolchain: The support of localizations. I may get it to work this week. But I'll be off for a ride to Italy then until the 4. Oct., so I gues we better wait until then to switch everything. (I mean: Don't deploy on a Friday, especially if you're off then...)

(6) We can write a news then, telling that Markcommon is supported. I've installed it the way Eric Holscher writes, but I haven't run any test on it yet.
